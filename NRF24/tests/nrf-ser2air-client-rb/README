This test is part of "libemb".


Introduction
------------

Test for "libnrf24l01". Firmware implements a simple USART to air gateway.  Data received on the first UART is send to to nRF24l01. Data received from the nRF24l01 is  printed out on the first USART. A baudrate of 9600 is used.  For both, the received and the send data on the USART are buffered through a ringbuffer. 

The client configures the nRF24l01 into Enhanced Shockburst mode with ACK payload.  

For instructions on compiling and flashing the README in toplevel test-directory.
