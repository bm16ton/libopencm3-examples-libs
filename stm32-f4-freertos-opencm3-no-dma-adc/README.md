# FreeRTOS STM32 F4 Lab

Code based on FreeRTOS v10, opencm3 and STM32F407 MCU

I released "from scratch"
- FSMC bus inteface w register tools
- ILI934 based console over FSMC bus
- UART buffered interface
- newlib minimal syscalls 
- Board RTC timer driver
- Random generator driver
- XPT2060 touchscreen driver over SPI
- Pen button IRQ handler

No guarantees. This code is given only as an sample.

But must work good. =) I try to publish a good code.
