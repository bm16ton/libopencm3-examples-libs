librfn - A general utility library
==================================

librfn is a collection of small library utilities collected whilst writing
"stuff" in C and wondering why I was writing the same type of code over and
over again.

It is neither organised nor comprehensive. Instead it is a pick 'n choose
library. If you like the code (and the license) use it. Either by copying the
raw C files into your application or, perhaps better, but integrating librfn
into your git project as either a submodule or subtree.

For library documentation see http://daniel-thompson.github.io/librfn .

Building
--------

Generally speaking librfn expects to be built using the build system of
whatever project it has been integrated into. It has no real dependancies (even
the code the assumes a POSIX OS is fairly clearly separated). It does however
has a simple build system based on the standard GNU autotools in order to allow
the demos and tests to be run from the librfn repo.

Try:

  ./configure
  make
  make check
  src/fibredemo

If you obtained librfn via git you must generate the configure script and
Makefile templates first:

  autoreconf -i

Integrating as a sub-module
---------------------------

Try:

  mkdir mycoolapp && cd mycoolapp && git init .
  git submodule add https://github.com/daniel-thompson/librfn.git

Integrating as a sub-tree
-------------------------

Try:

  mkdir mycoolapp && cd mycoolapp && git init .
  git remote add -f librfn https://github.com/daniel-thompson/librfn.git
  git subtree add --prefix librfn librfn master --squash

To update to the latest version of librfn:

  git fetch librfn master
  git subtree pull --prefix librfn librfn master --squash
