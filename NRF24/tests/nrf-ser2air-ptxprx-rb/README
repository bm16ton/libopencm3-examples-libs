Introduction
------------

Test for "libnrf24l01". Firmware implements a simple USART to air gateway.  Data received on the first USART is send to to nRF24l01. Data received from the nRF24l01 is  printed out on the first UART. A baudrate of 9600 is used.  The firmware is usable on server and client side. It configures the nRF24l01 into Shockburst mode, bidirectional communication is realized by continuously switching the nNRF24l01 form PTX to PRX and back.
